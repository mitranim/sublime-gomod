## Overview

Syntax definition for `go.mod` and `go.sum` files for Sublime Text. `go.mod` is a manifest file for Go packages;
read about it on <https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/>.

## Installation

Make sure you have [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io) installed,
then open Command Palette &rarr; Install Package &rarr; Gomod.

Alternatively, clone this repository into Sublime's Packages folder.
On MacOS, this is usually `"/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"`.
Find it using Sublime's menu &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Browse Packages.

## Usage

`*.mod` and `*.sum` files should be automatically highlighted. Enjoy!
