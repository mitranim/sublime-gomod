## Overview

Syntax definition for `go.mod` and `go.sum` files for Sublime Text. `go.mod` is a manifest file for Go packages; read about it on https://golang.org/cmd/go/.

## Installation

Make sure you have [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io) installed, then open Command Palette → Install Package → Gomod.

Alternatively, clone this repository into Sublime's Packages folder. On MacOS, this is usually `"/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"`. Find it using Sublime's menu → Preferences → Browse Packages.

## Usage

`*.mod` and `*.sum` files should be automatically highlighted. Enjoy!
